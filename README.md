## Background
Shall we learn machine learning ? Yes
But before that maybe we can play arround with some proffesional in this field
I use one simple dataset from twitter (courtesy:data.world)
https://data.world/crowdflower/2015-new-years-resolutions

Current objective : **To design, analyze, and build machine learning model with python sci-kit or tensor**

 ---- > Data shape
 4. Brainstorming and make decission before create model
 -----> Information that we can display (e.g)
 ---------- How many user that has positive sentiment toward new year resolution based on gender
 5. split data into two set (training and testing with this ratio 70% - 30% )
 6. Build data model
 7. Build feature
 8. Observe data statistic
 9. Ingest and automate training process
